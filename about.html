            <p class="pages-intro">
                Plagued with environmental and social issues, the fashion industry is responsible for up to 10 % of global CO2 emissions annually, higher than emissions from international shipping and aviation combined.<br>
                While the appeal of fast fashion lies in its accessibility and affordability, the true cost extends far beyond the price tag. From exploitative labor practices affecting marginalized workers to the environmental devastation caused by toxic dyes and synthetic materials, the industry's impact ripples across the globe.<br>
                Our consumption habits, fueled by social media's constant stream of new trends, have created an unsustainable cycle where the average person acquires 26 new garments annually. The disconnect between our environmental and social values and shopping behaviors is stark, but the solution is simple: we must embrace what we already own.<br>
                By extending the life of our existing clothes through repair, care, and rewear, we can significantly reduce our environmental footprint. <br>
                Every garment we maintain rather than replace, represents a step away from the devastating cycle of fast fashion and towards a more sustainable future. The most sustainable wardrobe isn't built through new purchases - it's cultivated through mindful care of what we already possess.
